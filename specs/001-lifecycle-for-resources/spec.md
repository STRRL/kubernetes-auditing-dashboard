**Created**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "lifecycle for resources, with given path, http://localhost:3000/lifecycle/<apigroup, gvk>/<resource-name>/ show the history of the objects, like create, update(with diff view), delete;"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

A cluster operator wants to understand what happened to a specific Kubernetes resource over time. They navigate to a dedicated page showing the complete lifecycle of that resource: when it was created, all updates made to it (with visual diffs highlighting what changed), and when it was deleted (if applicable). This helps them debug issues, audit changes, and understand the evolution of their infrastructure.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a Deployment named "webapp" exists in the audit history, **When** user navigates to `/lifecycle/apps-v1-Deployment/default/webapp`, **Then** they see a chronological timeline showing the create event, all update events with diffs, and any delete event

2. **Given** a ConfigMap was updated 3 times, **When** user views its lifecycle page, **Then** each update event displays a diff view highlighting the exact fields that changed between versions

3. **Given** a resource has been deleted, **When** user views its lifecycle page, **Then** the final event shows the deletion with the last known state of the resource

4. **Given** a user accesses a lifecycle page for the first time, **When** the page loads, **Then** events are displayed in reverse chronological order (newest events at top, oldest at bottom)

5. **Given** a resource name contains special characters or namespaces, **When** user navigates via the URL, **Then** the system correctly parses the resource identifier and displays the history

6. **Given** a user is viewing the Recent Changes page, **When** they click on a resource name in the table, **Then** they are navigated to the lifecycle page for that specific resource showing its complete history

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a resource has never existed (no audit events found)? Display empty state page
- What happens when two updates occur in rapid succession (milliseconds apart)? Display all events with full timestamps
- How are partial updates (patches) vs full replacements displayed? Show only the diff portions in both cases
- What happens when the resource data structure is malformed or incomplete in audit logs? Display available data with error indicators
- How does the system handle namespace-scoped vs cluster-scoped resources in the URL structure? All URLs use 3-segment pattern: namespaced resources use actual namespace, cluster-scoped use `_cluster` sentinel

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a URL pattern `/lifecycle/{apigroup-version-kind}/{namespace}/{resource-name}` that displays the complete history of a specific Kubernetes resource. For cluster-scoped resources, the namespace segment MUST be `_cluster` (e.g., `/lifecycle/v1-Namespace/_cluster/default`)

- **FR-002**: System MUST display all lifecycle events for a resource in reverse chronological order (newest first, oldest last), including: create, update, and delete events

- **FR-003**: System MUST show a diff view for each update event that highlights the exact changes between consecutive versions of the resource

- **FR-004**: System MUST extract and display event metadata for each lifecycle event: timestamp, user/service account that made the change, and event type (create/update/delete)

- **FR-005**: System MUST handle URL encoding for resource names and API group/version/kind combinations that contain special characters

- **FR-006**: System MUST display the final state of a deleted resource along with the deletion event

- **FR-007**: System MUST display an empty state page with the message "No audit event record" when no audit events are found for the requested resource identifier

- **FR-008**: System MUST support both namespaced and cluster-scoped resources. All URLs use 3-segment pattern: namespaced resources use actual namespace (e.g., `/lifecycle/apps-v1-Deployment/default/nginx`), cluster-scoped resources use `_cluster` sentinel (e.g., `/lifecycle/v1-Node/_cluster/worker-1`)

- **FR-009**: Diff view MUST display only the changed portions of the resource YAML, showing additions, deletions, and modifications to fields

- **FR-010**: System MUST handle resources that only have a create event (never updated or deleted)

- **FR-011**: System MUST display human-readable timestamps for all events formatted according to the browser's timezone

- **FR-012**: System MUST provide navigation links from the Recent Changes page to the lifecycle viewer. When a user clicks a resource name in the Recent Changes table, they MUST be directed to the corresponding lifecycle URL for that resource

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Resource Lifecycle Event**: Represents a single point-in-time change to a Kubernetes resource. Attributes include: event timestamp, event type (create/update/delete), resource state snapshot, user identity, API group/version/kind, resource name/namespace

- **Resource Diff**: Represents the changes between two consecutive versions of a resource. Attributes include: previous version snapshot, new version snapshot, list of changed fields with old/new values, change type (added/removed/modified) per field

- **Resource Identifier**: Uniquely identifies a Kubernetes resource across its lifecycle. Attributes include: API group, version, kind, resource name, optional namespace

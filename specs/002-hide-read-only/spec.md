# Feature Specification: Hide Read-Only Events by Default

**Feature Branch**: `002-hide-read-only`
**Created**: 2025-10-09
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "hide read only events on lifecycle page, like get/list/watch by default;. put a switch on the webpage, let user could control it;"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Parsed successfully
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: lifecycle page, read-only events (get/list/watch), default visibility, user control toggle
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí No critical ambiguities identified
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow defined: view lifecycle with filtered events, toggle to show all
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Event types and filter state
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Spec ready for review
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-09
- Q: How should Kubernetes audit event verbs beyond the examples (get/list/watch, create/update/delete/patch) be classified for filtering? ‚Üí A: Blacklist read-only; show rest
- Q: How long should the toggle preference persist when navigating between resource lifecycle pages? ‚Üí A: Persist indefinitely across browser sessions using localStorage

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user viewing the lifecycle of a Kubernetes resource wants to focus on meaningful change events (create, update, delete, patch) without visual clutter from read-only operations (get, list, watch). By default, the lifecycle page should hide these read-only events to provide a cleaner view of actual resource modifications. The user can toggle a switch to reveal all events when they need comprehensive audit visibility.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user navigates to a resource lifecycle page, **When** the page loads, **Then** all events except read-only operations (get, list, watch) are displayed, and read-only events are hidden by default
2. **Given** the lifecycle page is displaying filtered events (read-only hidden), **When** the user activates the "Show read-only events" toggle, **Then** all events including get/list/watch operations become visible
3. **Given** the lifecycle page is showing all events (read-only visible), **When** the user deactivates the toggle, **Then** the page returns to showing only non-read-only events
4. **Given** a user has set their preference for showing/hiding read-only events, **When** they navigate to a different resource lifecycle page or return later in a new browser session, **Then** the preference is retained and applied automatically

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a resource has only read-only events (no other operations)? The page should display an appropriate message indicating no non-read-only events exist, with guidance to enable the toggle to see read-only operations.
- How does the system handle mixed event sequences? Events should be filtered client-side while maintaining chronological order of visible events.
- What happens if there are no events at all? The existing empty state should be displayed.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST hide read-only events (specifically: get, list, watch operations) from the lifecycle timeline by default when a user loads a resource lifecycle page
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a visible toggle control that allows users to show or hide read-only events on the lifecycle page
- **FR-003**: Toggle control MUST clearly indicate its current state (whether read-only events are shown or hidden)
- **FR-004**: System MUST display all events except those explicitly blacklisted as read-only (get, list, watch) when read-only events are hidden
- **FR-005**: System MUST display all events (including read-only) when the toggle is activated
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve the user's toggle preference when navigating between different resource lifecycle pages within the same session
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain chronological ordering of events regardless of filter state
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide visual feedback when no non-read-only events exist but read-only events are available
- **FR-009**: Toggle control MUST be easily accessible and clearly labeled for user understanding

### Key Entities
- **Event Type Classification**: Events are filtered using a blacklist approach‚Äîonly get, list, and watch verbs are classified as "read-only" and hidden by default; all other event verbs are shown
- **Filter State**: User preference for showing or hiding read-only events, maintained during the session
